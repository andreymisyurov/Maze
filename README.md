This is not a finished project. I am developing it now.

I'm developing the creation of an ideal maze (with an algorithm for finding a short path)
and a game - "The Cave" (a cellular automaton as a game of life). UI will be with the QT library.

Complite:
- algorithm "The Cave"
- generate labirints

TODO:
- finding a short path
- UI
